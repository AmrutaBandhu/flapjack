 -------------                  -----------
 | populator |---          -----| results |
 -------------  |          |    -----------
                |          |
               --------------
               | beanstalkd |
               --------------
							        |
     -----------------------------------
	   |                |                |
  ----------      ----------       ----------
	| worker |      | worker |       | worker |
