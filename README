dependencies
============

 - beanstalkd
 - libevent1, libevent-dev

bundled: 
 - beanstalk-client


running 
=======

start up beanstalkd

populator.rb => puts work items on the 'jobs' tube
worker.rb => pops work items off the 'jobs' tube, puts results onto the 'results' tube
results.rb => processes job results off 'results' tube'
stats.rb => gets stats periodically from beanstalkd tubes


proposed architecture
=====================

(current implementation doesn't reflect this)

 -------------                  ------------
 | populator |---          -----| notifier |
 -------------  |          |    ------------
                |          |
               --------------
               | beanstalkd |
               --------------
							        |
     -----------------------------------
	   |                |                |
  ----------      ----------       ----------
	| worker |      | worker |       | worker |
	----------      ----------       ----------


- populator determines checks that need to occur, and puts jobs onto beanstalk
- workers pop jobs off the beanstalk, do job, put result onto beanstalk
- notifier pops results, notifies
